Database:

need to implement 'anyone' for some of these
need to get password for admin to database somehow
need to not check accesses when caller is admin or when variable is local
need to implement rollbacks:
    idea:
        Via lists, keep track of globals added, locals added, principals created, etc.
            - Globals added will store original value and variable name, etc.
        Before raising error in database or parser:
            Call rollback function remove all changes.

create principal:            done
change password:             done
set (set_command):           done
append (append_command):     done
local (local_commad):        done
foreach:                     done
set delegation:              done
delete delegation:           done
default delegator:           done
as principal:                done
