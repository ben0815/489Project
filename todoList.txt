Database:

not sure if default delegator is being done right, take a look at this
need to implement 'anyone' for some of these
need to get password for admin to database somehow
need to not check accesses when caller is admin or when variable is local

create principal:            done
change password:             done
set (set_command):           done
append (append_command):     done
local (local_commad):        done
foreach:                     done
set delegation:              done
delete delegation:           done
default delegator:           done
as principal:                done
    
Parser: 

clear local variables after each run
test all functionalities
clean up code
