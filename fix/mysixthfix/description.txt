Previously when principal was admin, and they were trying to delete all delegations from another principal, the dataserver would return nothing to the client and run into a KeyError. Now when the principal is admin, deleting all delegations from another principal, the dataserver removes the right from all global variables, since admin always has all rights to all variables. Also added checks to make sure user_losing_rights and user_getting_rights are not admin when the target is 'all'. This is to avoid KeyErrors. This fixes delete delegations when the target is 'all'.
