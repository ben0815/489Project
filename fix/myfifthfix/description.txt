This point of this fix was to solve the problem of dataserver returning nothing when delegations were being set or deleted from admin. Since these delegations have no overall effect (due to the fact that admin always has all rights to all variables), when the user losing or getting righs is admin, the database makes no changes. Previously, the database would actually try to perform the operation which resulted in a KeyError. The changes were made to lines 145 and 173 of Database.py.
