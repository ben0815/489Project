The main problem with all of these breaks was that our dataserver did not properly implement the security stack and the parser mistakingly appended the delete delegation status code every time a delete delegation command was executed. The first step was actually calling the delete delegation function in the database and accepting 'all' and identifiers as the target. Then we created a list that stores the set delegation commands executed. A function, check_permission, goes through the security stack and ensures that a user has a permission based on the transitive property of the security stack. This also required the default delegator function to be upgraded, so that a user is given all the rights that the default delegator has on the variables that they have delegate power on. Lastly, the delete delegation function was updated to only delete the matching set delegations in the security stack. The correct implementation of the security stack fixed almost all of the breaks against our dataserver.
