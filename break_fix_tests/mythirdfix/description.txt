Originally, by mistake, the parser was appending delete delegation status code every time instead of calling the delete_delegation function in the database. Parser delete_delegation case on line 965 has now been updated to get the correct variables and call the delete_delegation function in the database. This allows the data server to properly return DENIED and FAILED messages for delete delegation commands, instead of mistakingly appending the delete delegation message by default.
