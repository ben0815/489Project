Security Error: The admin creates a new principal, bob, and creates a new variable x. Bob is granted read permission on this variable x. In the next program, admin deletes bob's permission to read x. In the next program, the principal is bob, and they are able to return (read) x even though the admin took this permission from them. This should read DENIED, but instead the value of x is returned.
