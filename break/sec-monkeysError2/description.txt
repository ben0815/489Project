Security Error: The admin creates two new principals, rick and bob, and a variable x. They then give bob delegate powers on the variable x. In the next program, the principal is bob and he tries to give read permission on variable x to principal rick, but he is DENIED, even though he has delegate power on the variable x. Bob should not be denied because he has delegate power on x.
