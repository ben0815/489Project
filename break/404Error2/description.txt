Security Error: The admin creates two new principals, rick and bob, and a variable x. They then give bob delegate powers on the variable x. In the next program, the principal is bob and he gives read permission on variable x to principal rick. In the next program, rick tries to return (read) variable x, but they are DENIED. Bob gave rick read permission on x, so rick should be able to return the value.
