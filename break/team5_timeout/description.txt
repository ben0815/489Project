If a newline character is not provided at the very end of the program (i.e.
'***\n') then the program will hang and timeout. The build it spec indicates
that there should not be a newline character after '***'. This can be seen in
the Grammar section.

It looks like they make the assumption that a newline character should appear at
the end in their code at Interpreter.py:298-305.
