Security Error: In the first program, admin creates principals bob and rick, creates a variable x and then delegates bob write permission on that variable x. In the next program, bob is able to delegate write permission to rick, even though bob does not have delegate permission on x. This should result in DENIED, since any non-admin principal needs delegate power in order to delegate permissions on a variable.
